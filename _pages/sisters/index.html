intro: >
  <p>We are Loanne and Jordan Collyer, identical twin sisters from London who love everything fashion, travel and music! We are both full-time fashion and travel bloggers and DJs. Growing up in Portugal gave us an innate travel bug so when we're not jet setting to a paradisiacal island with blue seas and white sands, you'll find us behind the decks playing at a fashion party or a summer festival! We are so lucky to have each other to travel and experience new things with. We're living the dream and doing it together as sisters and best friends makes it even better! </p>

      <p class="text--lg">Having grown up in Portugal and being immersed in a completely new culture we have developed a constant urge to explore and discover new places and people. Copenhagen would have to be one of our dream destinations to visit and one that seems to fit comfortably with our lifestyle and way of being.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">First of all Copenhagen has been deemed the 'happy capital' – Loanne and I are naturally very positive and happy people so to be surrounded by like-minded people would be perfect and allow us to make long-lasting friendships! </p>
      <p class="text--lg">We love being active and outdoors, and in Copenhagen people cycle everywhere which we would definitely do – what a great way to see the city too! </p>
      <p class="text--lg">As fashion bloggers, being surrounded by design-led stores is fundamental and Copenhagen is full of them from trendy home furnishings to designer lights, we could literally spend hours shopping there together! </p>
      <p class="text--lg">I think the thing that excites us most about Copenhagen is the copious amounts of Michelin-star restaurants. We are the biggest foodies and we always say that we're both happiest when we're eating and discovering new food together.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">I would describe our style as quite minimal, casual and effortless. You're more likely to find us in comfortable jeans and an oversized knit than a dress and heels. The jewellery that compliments our style is also quite minimal. Nothing too extravagant. You'll always catch us wearing pendants and hoops. We love gold and being able to stack our jewellery is key!</p>
