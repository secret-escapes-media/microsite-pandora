intro: >
  <p class="text--lg">As a fashion & lifestyle YouTuber I’m always travelling to beautiful new destinations, but my most memorable trip was to the Maldives in 2012, where I met my other half, Charlie. We both now write our blogs full time, which is fabulous as we get to experience so much together, and work together on many occasions too!</p>

      <p class="text--lg">Charlie is a sun seeker, while I’m always on the look-out for photogenic spots, so Santorini would be our perfect destination. </p>
      <p class="text--lg">Since we met, we’ve always holidayed in the Greek Islands – you can’t beat them for hours of sunshine, incredible food and stunning scenery. </p>
      <p class="text--lg">Charlie makes friends with all the locals, so it wouldn’t be long before all of the taverna owners in Santorini knew his name! </p>
      <p class="text--lg">I’ve already got a folder of photogenic spots in Oia, so we’d spend each morning getting those perfect Instagram shots before relaxing in the sun for the rest of the day!</p>

      <p class="text--lg">My style is elegant and feminine and the same goes for my jewellery; I’m usually drawn to rose gold pieces. I love to layer up my jewellery, mixing long and short pendants, multiple rings etc to really create a personalized look. Once I fall in love with a piece, I’ll wear it all the time – so I always look for pieces that work just as well with an evening dress as they do with a cosy knit!</p>
