intro: >
  <p>I’m a Social Media & Marketing Executive turned into a fashion & lifestyle blogger, sharing my personal style as a busy, self-employed mother. I create laid-back, high-end looks, sharing adventures with my adorable son, my bubba – whom some may say dresses cooler than myself! Together we’ve created a mini fashion empire, with magazine features in Vogue, Grazia, Cosmopolitan and more. From the school run to a full day of meetings, followed by dinner, bedtime and then work on the laptop, my roles are varied – a mother, a business woman and an influencer.</p>

    title: Brighton may be a seaside escape for some, but I call it home.
    paragraph: >
      <p class="text--lg">It’s a city packed with adventure. It’s a great shopping destination, perfect for the compulsive shopper in me, covering high-street classics to cute boutiques. There’s always something for my curious five-year-old too, whether it’s the parks, attractions like the Sea Life Centre, or the iconic pier!</p>
      <p class="text--lg">Who doesn’t love spending a rainy afternoon in the buzzing arcades of the pier? Round it off with fish and chips on the famous pebble beach and Brighton really starts to capture the imagination.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">Brighton also offers vibrant nightlife for those weekends where I choose to feel young at heart! It’s a seriously cool seaside town, unlike any other in the UK. From boutique shopping in the famous Laines to the abundance of child-friendly activities, Brighton really is a special place for me and my son. As a busy, self-employed mother with a hectic schedule, it’s just perfect.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">Jewellery can make or break an outfit, so therefore it’s an important part of my day-to-day style. An eye for detail is always key to nailing a look, keeping it stylish and on-trend – mixing high street and high-end pieces to create chic outfits for a day of exploring the city. Everyday is a fashion show whether it's wearing sweats, trainers or blazers – who said you can't look glamorous whilst being a tourist in your own hometown?</p>
