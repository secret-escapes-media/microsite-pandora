intro: >
  <p class="text--lg">I’m Lauren, a wife-to-be and a mum of three – 10-month-old baby Rory, two-year-olds Ollie and Archie, and my step-son who has just turned 9. We live in rural Herefordshire with our old dog, Halle. Nothing makes me happier than spending time all together as a five.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">We’ve moved around a lot. I am Welsh and Colin is Scottish and our jobs have taken us all over Britain. We love the UK, and while cities have so much to offer, that pull to the countryside is strong.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">There’s nothing quite like driving through the Cotswolds on a beautiful summers day, or any day for that matter – it’s one of those counties that looks truly stunning all through the year. We’re so lucky to have such a breathtaking place right on our doorstep.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">From rolling hills and sweeping meadows to quaint honey-coloured villages and stately homes, the Cotswolds are just stunning. For us, the Cotswolds are a perfect blend of luxury and traditional British country living at its best! </p>
      <p class="text--lg">The Cotswolds have all that we need. While the bigger boys go bike riding or hiking with the dog, I can stroll around unique shops and rose scented gardens. It’s also home to some of the UK’s best spas.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">Cotswolds pubs and restaurants are out of this world, they are the epitome of British food and drink culture and almost always dog and family friendly. It’s a dream of a place, and a firm favourite with all of our family.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">To me jewellery is so much more than an accessory. I love pieces that signify moments in my life, or people that I love. Warmer tones like rose and yellow gold suit me better and I love how delicate these PANDORA items are. The perfect gift for Valentine’s Day.</p>
